		<h3>Purpose</h3>
		<p>Metro Community College in Omaha allows students to obtain a number of real world 
		experiences in technology to learn what today's employers are looking for from their 
		potential employees.  Many of the classes offered require students to generate, update, 
		and maintain websites as part of the course requirements.  All of the courses require the 
		use of the same domain, which creates difficulties when taking a degree's worth of classes.  
		This website is an attempt to organize the classes that I've taken in an attempt to maintain 
		the highest quality of pages for my instructors, provide a resource that can be provided to 
		potential employers, and display completed work samples that may have normally been lost 
		after completing a course.</p>
		
		<p>In taking a break from Metro Community College this quarter, they have shut down my website 
		through their servers.  I am now hosting my website and project files through Github as a way to 
		maintain my projects as well as have constant access to them.  This website is a running record of 
		completed coursework as well as a demonstration of my skills.</p>
		
		<p>If you are an instructor, please contact me directly if you have any concerns about the 
		organization or purpose of this website.  You'll find your course listed below.  Simply click 
		on your course and you'll find the desired posting page with the required documentation.  
		Thank you for your instruction and input in this process.</p>

		<h3>Projects</h3>
	
			<ul>
				<li><a href="resume/home.html">Resume</a></li>
					<p>The above link is one of my very first projects, before I took formal classes.  It is a 
					good starting point to see how I started out with HTML and CSS.  This page is meant to be a 
					living resume, but I never figured out how to share it with the world until now.  It 
					highlights some of the important features of my resume.  I apologize, it is not fancy, up-to-
					date, nor is it what I'm able do now.  This page is being updated as part of my process of 
					improving previous projects.</p>				
				<li><a href="Info1002/Info1002Home.html">Intro to IT</a></li>
					<p>This was an introductory course offered through Metro Community College.  Its purpose 
					was to expose students to a variety of professions within the IT field.  This page was 
					created as part of a branding project.  There are no external links, but the logo was self-
					generated.</p>
				<li><a href="Info1311/Info1311Home.htm">HTML - Web Development</a></li>
					<p>The page that you'll be directed to has a collection of HTML documents that demonstrate 
					the use of CSS, tables, links, and images in a number of examples.  The final was a multiple 
					page site that also incorporated forms and streaming media.  This link is an all encompassing 
					look at what I've experimented with in HTML.</p>
				<li><a href="Info1521/Info1521Home.html">Java Programming I</a></li>	
					<p>Beyond the programming principles covered in Info 2351, Intro to XML, this was the first true 
					programming course I've taken.  It covered the concepts relating to syntax, data types, control statements, 
					classes, methods, validation of data, inheritances, interfaces, and introduced Object Oriented Programming 
					concepts.  This course explored application building, without GUI's, that built on pervious concepts 
					relating to the language.  Code for this class can be found on my GitHub account if it is not 
					downloadable through the course page.</p>
				<li><a href="Info1531/Info1531Home.html">Java Programming II</a></li>
					<p>This course builds on the concepts covered in Java I.  This course will be completed in the fall of 
					2019.  Updates to come after the course completion.</p>
				<li><a href="Info1620/Info1620Home.html">Intro to Database Design</a></li>
					<p>This course looks at the construction and implementation of different databases.  This course will 
					be completed in the fall of 2019.  Updates to come after the course completion.</p>
				<li><a href="Info2351/Info2351Home.html">Intro to XML</a></li>
					<p>This class was largely done independently.  The course instructor provided us with a link to 
					a website, a set of PowerPoint slides, and provided us with a learning goal.  From these items, I 
					had to produce a document using Oxygen XML Editor.  The purpose was to demonstrate the ability to 
					produce well-formed, documents that could be validated using DTT, XPATH and XSLT.</p>
				<li><a href="JavaScript/rockpaperscissors/rockpaperscissors.html">JavaScript: Rock/Paper/Scissors Game</a></li>
					<p>This was my first experience with JavaScript, a simple game that explored introductory 
					concepts relating to the language.  This project has been ongoing and is updated periodically 
					in an attempt to make it better.  I know, how can you continue to improve on Rock, Paper, Scissors.</p>
				<li><a href="JavaScript/drumset/drumset.html">JavaScript: Drum Machine</a></li>
					<p>This is a silly example of what can be done with JavaScript.  I think it's great to demonstrate how 
					you can link the input from the user to a response from the computer they're interacting with.  Many of 
					my projects before this point were static or displayed information.  This project allows the user to 
					make some noise and have some silly fun.</p>
