     Observed need due to many classes requiring the use of this domain, but also 
	 wanting to keep the websites developed neat, organized and operational. This 
	 page will also be used to provide prospective employers a location to observe 
	 the coursework completed through MCC without needing several different links.

		<h3>Introduction</h3>
		<p>Metro Community College in Omaha allows students to obtain a number of real world 
		experiences in technology to learn what today's employers are looking for from their 
		potential employees.  Many of the classes offered require students to generate, update, 
		and maintain websites as part of the course requirements.  All of the courses require the 
		use of the same domain, which creates difficulties when taking a degree's worth of classes.  
		This website is an attempt to organize the classes that I've taken in an attempt to maintain 
		the highest quality of pages for my instructors, provide a resource that can be provided to 
		potential employers, and display completed work samples that may have normally been lost 
		after completing a course.</p>
		
		<p>In taking a break from Metro Community College this quarter, they have shut down my website 
		through their servers.  I am now hosting my website and project files through Github as a way to 
		maintain my projects as well as have constant access to them.</p>
		
		<p>If you are an instructor, please contact me directly if you have any concerns about the 
		organization or purpose of this website.  You'll find your course listed below.  Simply click 
		on your course and you'll find the desired posting page with the required documentation.  
		Thank you for your instruction and input in the process.</p>
