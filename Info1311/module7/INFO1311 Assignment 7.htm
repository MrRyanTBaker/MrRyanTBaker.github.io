<p align="left"><img src="INFO1311%20Assignment%207_files/survey_screen.png" alt="Sample Form" style="float:right" width="505" height="724">Using
 a text editor, create a new web page that  validates as an HTML5 
file.&nbsp;Create the Music Survey form shown in the illustration on the
 right using the guidelines below: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Include an h1 element explaining the topic of the page</li>
  <li>Include a brief statement&nbsp;above&nbsp;the form that explains 
the purpose of the form and what you will do with the information once 
it is submitted.</li>
  <li>Include the following form controls:
    <ul>
      <li>A text box for the first name&nbsp;along with the label First Name</li>
      <li>A text box for&nbsp;the last name along with the label Last Name</li>
      <li>Text box for the email address along with the label E-mail</li>
      <li>A check box group with the 6 choices shown in the illustration. Use the fieldset and legend to group these elements.</li>
      <li>A radio button group with the 4 choices shown in the illustration. Use the fieldset and legend to group these elements.</li>
      <li>A select list with these four options: empty option as the first item, Online, Retail Store, and Other.</li>
      <li>A scrolling text box that is 60 characters wide</li>
      <li>Submit and Reset buttons</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Save the file in your module7 folder and name it <strong>music_survey.html</strong>. </li>
  <li>Format the form using an external CSS file. The style of your 
finished form will not match the format in the illustration provided. 
Save this file using a logical file name in the module7 folder. As a 
minimum requirement, include rules for the following elements: body, h1,
  fieldset, and legend. Include any additional rules as needed.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">You will use the formmail.asp script on our server to 
process the form when submitted.&nbsp;Please use the following 
information to process the Music Survey form.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Set up the   form so that the action is controlled by a CGI script at the URL <strong>https://www.mccinfo.net/webresources/cgi-bin/formmail.asp</strong><em>. </em>Instructions   on how to use the script are available in Module 7.  </li>
  <li>Use your MCC email address as the recipient when testing the 
form.&nbsp; Once you are finished testing the form, change the recipient
 email address to  your instructor's email address (which can be found 
in the syllabus).&nbsp;&nbsp;Remember that you cannot test the form from
 your local drive. You must upload the form to your web site and test it
 from the server.</li>
  <li>Set the subject line of the email message to be <strong>"INFO1311 Form Assignment"</strong></li>
  <li style="FONT-FAMILY: sans-serif">Include   hidden tags for the following fields as explained in the Usage Instructions for   the formmail script: <span class="codestyle">required </span>(you could also use the new HTML5 attribute but be sure to indicate on the form in some way which fields are required)<span class="codestyle">, return_link_url </span>(link back to the form itself)<span class="codestyle">, return_link_title, bgcolor </span>or<span class="codestyle"> background, title, text_color, font_face </span>and<span class="codestyle"> font_size. </span>Many
 of these hidden input tags will be used to format the default return 
page. So the intent is to make the  return page look like it "belongs" 
with  the form page.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Test your page in the browser and validate your code using the W3C Validator tool</li>
</ul>
<h3>When Finished...</h3>
<p>All students need to upload your assignment to the server and modify your INFO1311 home page (default.htm) as instructed below:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Upload the <strong>module7</strong> folder to the server. Make 
sure that the folders and files stay organized on the server exactly the
 same as they are organized on your local drive.</li>
  <li>Open your <strong>default.htm</strong> file and add a ink to <strong>Assignment 7</strong> by pointing to the <strong>music_survey.html</strong> file in the  module7 folder. </li>
  <li>Save the <strong>default.htm</strong> file and upload it into your
 top level folder. You will replace the file that is already there by 
the same name. I recommend that you open your revised INFO1311 Home Page
 that you uploaded to the server 
  in the browser and test your links to your Assignments. </li>
  <li>Copy the URL to your assignment into the assignment  dropbox in Blackboard.</li>
  <li><strong>On-campus Students Only--Optional: </strong>Print the code for the CSS<strong></strong> file and the <strong>music_survey.html</strong>  file in the text editor. Turn these in to your instructor.</li>
</ul>
