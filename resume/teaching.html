    <h2>Teaching Experiences</h2>
    <p>Throughout my life I've had a wide range of opportunities to work with people and the things they care about.
    I've worked with peoples' money, their homes, and their children.  In each setting, I've displayed a great deal of
    responsiblity and professionalism.  The details below highlight some of my accomplishments and duties over
    the last decade plus.</p></br>

    <fieldset>
        <a href="http://bryan.ops.org" target="_blank">Bryan High School</a></li><br>
                <ul>
                <li>Teaching</li>
                    <p>I am primarily responsible for the implementation and tracking of IEP goals. I created, organized, and revised the curriculum for a high school's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_skills" target="_blank">Behavior Skills Program</a> (BSP). 
                    This entails determining the needs of students, developing teaching materials that were enriching and high interest, assessing student progress, modifying materials based on 
                    assessment data, and differentiating instruction to reach a variety of learning modalities. While conducting instruction within the BSP room, I was also responsible for assigning 
                    duties, monitoring progress and researching professional development materials for a paraprofessional.

                    <p>In having a degree in K-12 PE, I also helped administer the school's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_education" target="_blank">ACP</a>, Alternative Curriculum Program, PE program.  This required me to modify the traditional physical education 
                    program to suit students with developmental and physical disabilities.  I assisted in the promotion and development of multi-school outings where students could engage in competition 
                    in a safe, welcoming environment.</p>

                    <p>As a special education teacher, I tracked the progress of student <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individualized_Education_Program" target="_blank">Individual Education Plan</a> (IEP) goals as well as their academic progress. In tracking this progress, I developed 
                    interventions to promote social, emotional, and cognitive skill success. Data collection and implementation was done in a strategic and confidential manner.</p>

                    <p>I also had an opportunity of co-teaching with a number of professionals. Co-teaching opportunities allowed for me to work with content teachers that had special education students
                    in their classroom. I have co-taught in the areas of Biology, Physical Science, English 1-2, American Government, World History, Algebra 1-2, and Geometry.  I helped modify curriculum 
                    to address student learning needs while considering the district standards. I assisted in the implementation of instruction, assessment of students, and classroom management.</p>
                
                <li>Coaching</li>
                    <p>I ensure that my students are eligible to compete in competition by adhering to the district and state's 
                    eligibility requirements for student physical, cognitive, and emotional needs.  As a coach at <a href="http://omahabryanbears.com" target="_blank">Bryan High School</a>,
                    you wear many different hats to ensure the various needs of the student athlete are met. At times you must be a mentor, counselor,
                    trainer, friend, teacher, role model, parent, transportion specialist, and then a coach.  I've learned that coaching is more
                    than simply playing a game, you need to consider the complete person and their development.</p>
                    
                    <p>I fulfill the responsibilities delegated to a head coach in high school athletics. I report scores 
                    and stats through <a href="http://gc.com/" target="_blank">Game Changer</a>, <a href="https://pressbox.getvnn.com/marketing.html" target="_blank"> Press Box</a>, and <a href="http://www.maxpreps.com/" target="_blank">Max Preps</a>. 
                    With 3 assistant coaches, I delegate responsibilities to advance our standards and our program.  I collaborate on 
                    a regular basis with various members of the administrative team to make sure that competitions went as scheduled, players 
                    arrived on time to competitions, and communicated expectations to parents.  I also coordinate purchasing and quality of
                    materials with a local representative.  These duties are in addition to the live responsibilities that are required on the 
                    field like batting strategy, injury assessment, and offensive and defensive situations.</p>
                    
                    <p>Before my time as a head coach, I was an assistant coach.  As an assistant coach, I executed the practice plans that were developed by my head coach.  My primary focus was skills 
                    development of the outfield.  Skills of catching, throwing and footwork were addressed on a regular basis as well as the mental and physical demands of playing sports.  On trips, 
                    it was my duty to supervise the bus and make sure that the players were representing the program in a favorable manner.  I assisted the head coach on the field by reinforcing her 
                    expectations, explaining strategic principles, and by being an active coach on first base.</p>
                    
                    <p>My efforts in coaching soccer are similar in nature to softball.  I'm responsible for the well-being of my players, responsible for the team during competition, and communicating my 
                    accomplishments and concerns with the coaching staff and administration.  It is a different skill set, with different athletes.  Beyond the general responsibilities of coaching, I assist in 
                    tracking statistics for the varsity program and help enforce team expectations.  Being a part of the transition in coaching programs, I've been able to see how the program has developed from 
                    simply a team, into a family.</p>
                    
                    <p>I started coaching girls basketball as a volunteer.  Through my demonstartion of knowledge of the sport, dedication to the players, and improvement in athletic acheievement, I was offered
                    an assistant coaching position.  I was responsible for coaching the lower level teams and developing players that have never played organized sports before.  This poses interesting challenges 
                    due to a wide gaps in understanding.  As a coach, I was responsible to teaching not only the skills and rules but also sportsmanship, what it means to be a teammate, and how to be competative 
                    in a high school setting.  Coaching basketball introduced me to different coaching styles, the challenges to coaching a long season, and how to connect with athletes of all ability levels.  </p>
                

                
                <li>Additional Duties</li>
                <p>I was active in the school's SSDS, Safe, Secure and Disciplined School, program.  I took on additional hours of supervision to help demonstrate a welcoming and consistent teacher presence in the hallways.  It was the goal of the staff to provide a safe environment that engaged 
                the students with positive interactions.  I took on posts that were high traffic and tried my best to connect with students of all backgrounds in each position.</p>
                
                <p>Periodically, normally around conferences, I would participate in tutoring sessions.  Requests for tutoring began with students that I had in class as well as previously had in class, trying to get help before grades went in.  Students complimented my teaching
                style as being easy to understand, patient, and conscious of their learning needs.  At these times, I was able to help students complete their homework, add depth of knowledge to their content and help them in taking better notes.  I was able to directly observe student 
                progress by their progress in assignments, the development of their questioning, and the progression of their materials since the last meeting.  The tutoring sessions that I've been a part of have been done on a volunteer basis in the areas of mathematics, science and history.</p>

        <fieldset>
        <a href="http://blackburn.ops.org" target="_blank">Blackburn Alternative Program</a></br>
            <ul>
                <li>Teaching</li>
                
                <p>Blackburn Alternative High School is a school that services students that are not being successful in a traditional setting or are transitioning between the juvenile justice system.  In the classroom, I had to address stresses that may not be 
                addressed in a traditional setting such as gang involvement, substance abuse, and violent, overt behaviors.  I co-taught with a team in the areas of Biology, Food Science, and Human Growth and Development.  This entailed the planning, implementation, 
                and modification of curriculum materials from a special education viewpoint.</p>
                
                <p>As a special education teacher, I had to fulfill many roles.  Primarily, I tracked the progress of student  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individualized_Education_Program" target="_blank">Individual Education Plan</a> (IEP) goals as well as their academic progress.  In tracking this progress, I developed interventions to promote social, 
                emotional, and cognitive skill success.  I collected data and then implemented interventions in a strategic and confidential manner.  Progress, or the lack thereof, was communicated with parents, teachers, administrators and outside institutions that were 
                responsible for the student's education.</p> 
                
                <p>To address student needs, I appropriated supplies and building space.  This was done by looking at current room usages, meeting with administration to discuss a greater building plan, cleaned and moved materials from a variety of spaces, and developed 
                procedures and tracking methods to utilize the appropriated spaces.  The primary focus was to maximize efficiency of space to increase student learning and engagement.  These actions allowed for a variety of learning opportunities that weren't originally available.</p>
                
                <li><a href="http://www.skillsusa.org" target="_blank">Skills USA</a></li>
                <p>This was a rewarding but short lived duty.  I was the direct assistant to the director of the progam and was in charge of recruiting individuals to participate in the program, transportation of students to events, checking uniforms before competitions, and supervising 
                students and making sure the code of conduct was followed.  I assisted a member of the team in competition, where she made it to a semi-final round for resume writing and interview skills.  I worked with this program until I was transfered to another school that already had 
                a team in place.</p>
                
                <li>Additional Duties</li>
                <p>Blackburn Alternative is not allowed to have sports that compete against other schools for a couple of reasons.  It was explained to me that they do not want students to purposefully be expelled from school to try and play for this school.  Another reason was that in competition, many of 
                the athletes would have to play or visit schools that they had been expelled from.  After some discussions with the administration team, I was able to conduct an after school weight training program.  Students that had permission from their parents, could stay after school and work 
                on proper weight lifting techniques, participate in workouts, and how to maintain the weight room sanitarily as well as maintenance wise.  Students that participated were given instruction on safety procedures, how to check for damaged equipment, how to prevent equipment from getting damaged, and 
                the various muscle groups that are targeted by exercises.  This program was looked at as an oppotunity for students that wanted to be involved in athletics, to get involved.</p>
                
                <p>In an effort to raise staff moral and bring people together, the Blackburn Event Committee was created. As one of three members, I helped coordinate fundraising events by ordering materials, keeping detailed records of the finances, communicating with other committee members to determine the best 
                way to conduct a sale, and requesting the proper paperwork from the administration to conduct the fundraisers.  Funds that were collected were used for an end of the year staff "roast".  Awards were made and distributed to each staff member.  The awards were delivered with a little story that made fun of 
                some quality.  I produced a PowerPoint presentation to accompany the stories.  This was the start of a tradition that I was a part of until I was transfered to Bryan High School. </p>

            <h2>Work Experiences</h2></br>
            <p>Through recent history, I've devoted the majority of my time to teaching related activities.  Although it has been a while, I feel that my experience in other fields is also important to understanding who I am.
            Below are a few of the jobs that I heald in the past that have developed my work ethics, broadened my professional knowledge, and opened up my understanding of what people value.</p>
        <fieldset>    
        <a href="http://www.penfed.org" target="_blank">Pentagon Federal Credit Union</a>
        
                <p>As a customer service representative, I had the ability to help the credit union members in a variety of facets.  My primary responsibility was to handling member concerns about their accounts in a timely and professional manner through PFCU's phone service.  
                This included establishing accounts, transferring funds, setting up loans, and resolving account conflicts.  I received regular compliments on my professionalism with difficult members and my general job performance.</p> 

                <p>Due to my successes I had the ability to receive additional training in other departments.  I worked with the research department that received and sent wire transfers, fraud prevention, balancing out the credit union accounts at the end of the day, and 
                issuing checks from member accounts.  I was able to carry this added knowledge to my regular position, making me a more well-rounded representative.</p>
               
        <li>Drywall</li>
        <ul>
            <p>For approxiamately four years, I worked on small crews that were responsible for the hanging, finishing and repair of drywall.  I worked in both commercial and residential settings, so I have had an opportunity to learn from both of these settings.  Within a residential 
            setting I learned the unique nature that people have about their belongings and where they live.  I gained an appreciation for their materials, as they would treat them.  Although their home and items were not mine, I would treat them as if they were, if not better.  
            I also learned an applied the importance of being prompt.  Many times I relied on the homeowner to gain access to their homes, lock up afterwards, or be given specific concerns about the work that needed to be completed.  If I was late, it was a reflection of how I would be 
            performing on a larger level.  Within the commercial setting, I learned how to coordinate my work around various deadlines and schedules.  This required clear communication with individuals I had never met, but had a common goal with.  There were oftentimes more people involved 
            and it was essential to stick to the plan and communicate any concerns to the various moving parts.</p>
            
            <p>In addtion to working on crews, I did side-projects to make additional money.  I had to apply the above mentioned skills, but also take care of pricing, ordering of materials, delivery of materials, and complications relating to my craftsmanship.  This helped me develop 
            skills in negotiation and I had address concerns differently.  My business spread word-of-mouth, so customer service was of the highest priority to ensure that additional business came in.  At its peak, I did not work on crews, but rather my own work.  I chose to leave this 
            business in order to finish school and pursue a career in the education field.</p>
        </ul>
        </fieldset>

    <h2>Additional Experience</h2>
    <p>Working and education highlight the professional duties I've undertaken and learning that was undertaken to make it 
    possible.  Below are a collection of tasks that I've completed or participated in, expanding my personal and professional experiences.</p></br>
     <fieldset>
         <ul>
        <li>Science Curriculum Writing</li>
        <p>I had an opportunity to partake in my district's curriculum planning and writing.  In addition to the discussions relating to the curriculum,  I helped in educating teachers on any changes as well as developed supplimental materials that helped to teach to the standards throughout 
        the year.  The PowerPoints and supplimental materials were deseminated throughout the district and were posted in the science repository for school staff.  My primary focus related to elementary sciences, grades 3-5, and biology, which I have taught an equivilancy of 10 years in.  Although
        those were my primary areas, I also assisted in the chemestry and physics areas.  I worked alongside science teachers and district supervisors in developing and implementing the changes to the overall curriculum.</p>
        <li>Safety Manual Rewrite</li>
        <p>With the successes that I had experienced, I was invited to help in rewriting the district's science safety manual.  It was my duty to research other manuals, determine out-of-date material, report changes and ammendments to the master copy, and develop testing questions to assess student 
        knowledge about the manual.  Using information from some of the industry's leading suppliers, <a href="http://labsafety.flinnsci.com/Home.aspx" target="_blank">Flinn Scientific Inc.</a>, I was able to collaboratively update the standards for safety that was provided to teachers and then taught 
        to high school students around the district.</p>
