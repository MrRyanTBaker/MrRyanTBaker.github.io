    <h2>Educational Experience</h2>

		<p>This institution has provided me with a well-rounded approach to IT principles.  I have taken courses relating to networking, 
		network security, digital forensics, Java programming, XML programming, and have had a broad introduction to the career fields that 
		are available within the tech field.  I have participated in a blend of educational methods from inclass, hybrid and online.</p>            
            
        <li><a href="http://www.unl.edu/" target="_blank">University of Nebraska at Lincoln</a></li>
        <p>In participating in courses at UNL's graduate program, I embodied the skills of a competent and confident professional.  I worked with teachers, administrators and counselors to develop a plan, complete the required projects in a timely manner, and engaged in professional 
        development opportunities.  This was done by participating in technology driven, distance learning as well as direct, classroom instruction to obtain a Masters Degree in Special Education with a focus in Emotional Disorders.</p>
