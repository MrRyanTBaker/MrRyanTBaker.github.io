			<h1><em>Welcome to CoWorking</em></h1>
			<p>We would like to welcome you to the Coworking Space, Coworking is a method of collaborative 
			working for independent professionals which provides them with a comfortable and professional space 
			in which to work along with the companionship of like-minded people.  Coworking also provides a sort of 
			"cafe culture", promoting intellectual exchange, friendships with other people in often isolated industries, 
			fellowship.  A fully trained staff is always on hand to train and guide you.</p>
